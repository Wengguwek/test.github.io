        <br><br>My grandpa fought in World War II<br>
He was such a noble dude<br>
I can't even finish school<br>
Missed my mom, and left too soon<br>
His dad was a fireman<br>
Who fought fires so violent<br>
I think I bored my therapist<br>
While playing him my violin<br>
that's so insane<br>
(Oh, my God) that's such a shame<br>
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand<br>
But I can't help myself from feeling bad<br>
I kinda feel like two things can be said (one, two, three, four)<br>
The world's smallest violin<br>
Really needs an audience<br>
So if I do not find somebody soon (that's right, that's right)<br>
I'll blow up into smithereens<br>
And spew my tiny symphony<br>
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you<br>
My grandpa fought in World War II<br>
And he was such a noble dude<br>
Man, I feel like such a fool<br>
I got so much left to prove<br>
All my friends have vaping friends<br>
They're so good at making friеnds<br>
I'm so scared of caving in<br>
Is that entertaining yеt?<br>
that's so insane<br>
(Oh, my God) that's such a shame<br>
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand<br>
But I can't help myself from feeling bad<br>
I kinda feel like two things can be said (one, two, three, four)<br>
The world's smallest violin<br>
Really needs an audience<br>
So if I do not find somebody soon (that's right, that's right)<br>
I'll blow up into smithereens<br>
And spew my tiny symphony<br>
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you<br>
Somewhere in the universe<br>
Somewhere someone's got it worse<br>
Wish that made it easier<br>
Wish I didn't feel the hurt<br>
The world's smallest violin<br>
Really needs an audience<br>
So if I do not find somebody soon<br>
I'll blow up into smithereens<br>
And spew my tiny symphony<br>
All up and down a city street<br>
While tryna put my mind at ease<br>
Like finishing this melody<br>
This feels like a necessity<br>
So this could be the death of me<br>
Or maybe just a better me<br>
Now, come in with the timpanis<br>
And take a shot of Hennessy<br>
I know I'm not there mentally<br>
But you could be the remedy<br>
So let me play my violin for you</text>
